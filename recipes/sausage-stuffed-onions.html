        <h2>Sausage Stuffed Onions Recipe</h2>
        <p>These sausage stuffed onions are time-consuming but worth it in the end. Use whatever onions you have on hand and whichever Italian sausage you prefer. I personally like red onions and hot Italian sausage best. These are company-worthy, and best served with bread for mopping up all of that delicious pan juice.</p>
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 large red onions</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
            
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            
            <li>12 ounces Italian sausage (about 3 links, casing removed)</li>
            
            <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
            
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
            
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>

            <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumb</li>

            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>

            <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Trim the stem end of each onion by 1/4 to 1/2 inch; trim roots off, while leaving the root end of the onion intact. Peel off the paper shell and discard.</li>
            <li>Cut each onion in half horizontally. Using a melon baller or paring knife, hollow out each half to form a bowl. Leave at least 3 layers of onion around the outside so that your bowl will hold its shape while cooking. Reserve the scooped-out onion.</li>
            <li>Place onions on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Roast onions in the preheated oven until as tender as you like, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, chop reserved onion. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion; cook 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook until onion is deeply caramelized, about 10 minutes more. Turn heat off and let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Add Italian sausage, caramelized onions, parsley, thyme, garlic, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and panko to a large bowl. Mix well and form into 6 balls. Divide balls between the onion halves. Add chicken broth and wine to the bottom of the baking dish</li>
            <li>Return to the oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese over the top. Bake until cheese is golden and sausage is no longer pink, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>

        </ol>
